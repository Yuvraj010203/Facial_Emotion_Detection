# Facial Emotion Detection

This project is a Facial Emotion Detection System that classifies human emotions based on facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained on images labeled with seven different emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The trained model can then predict emotions from new images.
